        <h2>Email</h2>
        <ul class="area">
            <li>
                The most convenient way to reach me is by sending an email to my official inbox at sltzeng@math.nsysu.edu.tw. However, if you haven't received a response from me after a considerable period, it might be due to technical issues. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In the event of not receiving a response, try reaching out to me at slt.cmu@gmail.com. While I don't check this email inbox as frequently, it serves as a viable alternative. 
            </li>
        </ul> <hr> <br> 
        <h2>Work with me</h2> <br>
        <p>My research areas are briefly summarized in [Research] tab. If you believe that your question falls within my area of expertise and can be addressed by me, feel free to contact me for a further discussion.</p> <br>
        <h3>Postdoctoral researcher</h3> <br>
        <p>In general, my grant does not support a postdoctoral researcher position. Alternatively, you could apply the postdoctoral fellowship in <a href="https://ncts.ntu.edu.tw/">NCTS</a>, which usually release the hiring information in February and September on their website.</p> <br>
        To work with me, you are expected to have <br>
        <ul class="area">
            <li>strong command of multivariate statistical analysis and matrix calculation</li>
            <li>research experiences using programming, such as R/Python</li>
            <li>speaking proficiency in either English or Mandarin</li>
            <li>the ability to work independently and resolve problems, so that my role is to provide you with suggestions and recommendations based on my experience</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Students</h2> <br>
        <p>I am happy to work with graduate and undergraduate students. Students whom I am eager to mentor should have the following characteristics.</p>
        <ul class="area">
            <li>enthusiasm in solving a practical problem</li>
            <li>experiences in programming, such as R/Python/MATLAB/SAS</li>
            <li>capability to formulate a feasible learning plan and adhere to it consistently</li>

        <p>If you intend to work with me, please send me an email clarifying your purpose and outlining how you believe you meet the criteria above.</p> <hr>
        <h2>Letter of Recommendation</h2> <br>
        <p>I have the capacity each semester to assist merely four students with writing recommendation letters. Therefore, I kindly advise everyone to prepare in advance and, at the very least, compile the following materials and send it to me at least two weeks prior to the submission deadline.</p>
        <ul class="area">
            <li>The following information organized in a table:
                <ul class="areas">
                    <li>full names of the schools, departments, and programs you plan to apply to</li>
                    <li>method of submitting recommendation letters (online or hard copy)</li>
                    <li>application deadline</li>

            </li>
            <li>Transcripts of academic records</li>
            <li>Supporting documents (such as a personal statement, study plan)</li>
            <li>A list of reasons you believe the institution should admit you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please avoid those wrong examples in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQNr9VRa7B394MY9FPcekZE_c_Z0YmrseVYSBMIpaOT0FeO-ytgGI5L2N1u60vt-3wvRbNirNdmeUeq/pub">Case Study of Email Errors</a> and write a clear and precise mail for help.</p> <br>
