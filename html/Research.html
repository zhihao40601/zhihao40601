            <div>&emsp;&emsp;Most of SpatXviz’s research works were motivated by real applications, which belong to the following categories.</div>

        <div class="article">1.Extending the Models for Spatio-temporal Data Prediction</div>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Massive data become easily accessible due to recent open data movements. A large portion of them involve geographical locations. Spatial statistics was the typical method for such kind of data, but it becomes infeasible for the exploding volumes of data. But the existing methods are limited by their complexity, making it difficult to handle the ever-increasing volume of data being collected. Our recent focus of research has been on finding ways to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining the flexibility of the model. We have been engaged in at least the following related areas.</p><br>

        <div class="article">2.	Statistical problems arising from using dense air pollution data:</div>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;PM2.5 pollution is harmful to human health, and the air quality monitoring stations managed by the Environmental Protection Agency provide high-quality measurements. However, the stations are expensive to establish and sparsely distributed, with only 77 monitoring stations in Taiwan. In contrast, the recent airbox monitoring network consists of thousands of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) sensing devices, offering advantages in terms of spatial coverage. Airbox data is often complex and of unstable quality, which has motivated us in at least the following aspects.</p> <br>

        <div class="article">3.	Classification/clustering with curve data and images</div>  
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Spatial statistics originally dealt with curve or surface interpolation. In biomedical research, it is common to encounter data with curve or surface characteristics, making it possible to adapt these techniques and apply them to specific problems. These endeavors bridge gaps between one-dimensional and higher-dimensional functional data analysis, inspiring novel approaches in the field.</p> <br>

        <div class="article">4.	High-dimensional data visualization</div>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Amidst evolving data collection techniques, numerous studies confront the high-dimensional data challenge due to an abundance of variables surpassing sample sizes. During 2003-2006, collaboration on matrix visualization at Academia Sinica yielded publications illustrating subject-variable relations with minimal assumptions. Addressing infinite variables in functional data, discussions with British researchers explored outlier detection and visualization's role, particularly in medical images, shaping future research direction</p> <br>
